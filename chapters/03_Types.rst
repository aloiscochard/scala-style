Types
=====

Inference
---------

Use type inference as much as possible.  You should almost never annotate the type
of a ``val`` field as their type will be immediately evident in their value::
    
    val name = "Daniel"
    
However, type inference has a way of coming back to haunt you when used on
non-trivial methods which are part of the public interface.  Just for the sake
of safety, you should annotate all public methods in your class.

Function Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Function values support a special case of type inference which is worth calling
out on its own::
    
    val ls: List[String] = ...
    ls map { str => str.toInt }
    
In cases where Scala already knows the type of the function value we are declaring,
there is no need to annotate the parameters (in this case, ``str``).  This is an
intensely helpful inference and should be preferred whenever possible.  Note that
implicit conversions which operate on function values will nullify this inference,
forcing the explicit annotation of parameter types.

"Void" Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The exception to the "annotate everything public" rule is methods which return
``Unit``.  *Any* method which returns ``Unit`` should be declared using Scala's
syntactic sugar for that case::
    
    def printName() {
      println("Novell")
    }
    
This compiles into::
    
    def printName(): Unit = {
      println("Novell")
    }
    
You should prefer the former style (without the annotation or the equals sign)
as it reduces errors and improves readability.  For the record, it is also
possible (and encouraged!) to declare abstract methods returning ``Unit`` with an
analogous syntax::
    
    def printName()         // abstract def for printName(): Unit
    

Annotations
-----------

Type annotations should be patterned according to the following template::
    
    value: Type
    
This is the style adopted by most of the Scala standard library and all of
Martin Odersky's examples.  The space between value and type helps the eye in
accurately parsing the syntax.  The reason to place the colon at the end of the
value rather than the beginning of the type is to avoid confusion in cases such
as this one::
    
    value :::
    
This is actually valid Scala, declaring a value to be of type ``::``.  Obviously,
the prefix-style annotation colon muddles things greatly.  The other option is
the "two space" syntax::
    
    value : Type
    
This syntax is preferable to the prefix-style, but it is not widely adopted due
to its increased verbosity.


Ascription
----------

Type ascription is often confused with type annotation, as the syntax in Scala
is identical.  The following are examples of ascription:

* ``Nil:List[String]``
* ``Set(values:_*)``
* ``"Daniel":AnyRef``

Ascription is basically just an up-cast performed at compile-time for the sake of
the type checker.  Its use is not common, but it does happen on occaision.  The
most often seen case of ascription is invoking a varargs method with a single
``Seq`` parameter.  This is done by ascribing the ``_*`` type (as in the second
example above).

Ascription usually follows the type annotation conventions except that no spaces
are inserted between value and type.  This more compact form is *usually* prefered
as it improves compactness without hindering readability.  With ascription, the
type is a logical part of the value being explicitly stated.  This is not the
case with a type annotation.

Of course, there are times when the "spaceless syntax" breaks down and hinders
legibility.  In such cases, the correct "fallback" is to use the convention
employed for type annotations (e.g. ``Nil: List[String]``).


Functions
---------

Function types should be declared with a space between the parameter type, the
arrow and the return type::
    
    def foo(f: Int => String) = ...
    
    def bar(f: (Boolean, Double) => List[String]) = ...
    
Parentheses should be omitted wherever possible (e.g. methods of arity-1, such
as ``Int => String``).

Arity-1
~~~~~~~

Scala has a special syntax for declaring types for functions of arity-1.  For
example::
    
    def map[B](f: A => B) = ...
    
Specifically, the parentheses may be omitted from the parameter type.  Thus, we
did *not* declare ``f`` to be of type "``(A) => B``, as this would have been
needlessly verbose.  Consider the more extreme example::
    
    // wrong!
    def foo(f: (Int) => (String) => (Boolean) => Double) = ...
    
    // right!
    def foo(f: Int => String => Boolean => Double) = ...
    
By omitting the parentheses, we have saved six whole characters and dramatically
improved the readability of the type expression.


Structural Types
----------------

Structural types should be declared on a single line if they are less than 50
characters in length.  Otherwise, they should be split across multiple lines and
(usually) assigned to their own type alias::
    
    // wrong!
    def foo(a: { def bar(a: Int, b: Int): String; val baz: List[String => String] }) = ...
    
    // right!
    private type FooParam = {
      val baz: List[String => String]
      def bar(a: Int, b: Int): String
    }
    
    def foo(a: FooParam) = ...
    
Simpler structural types (under 50 characters) may be declared and used inline::
    
    def foo(a: { val bar: String }) = ...
    
When declaring structural types inline, each member should be separated by a
semi-colon and a single space, the opening brace should be *followed* by a space
while the closing brace should be *preceded* by a space (as demonstrated in both
examples above).
