## Nested Blocks

### Curly Braces

Opening curly braces (``{``) must be on the same line as the declaration they
represent:
    
    def foo = {
      ...
    }
    
Technically, Scala's parser *does* support GNU-style notation with opening braces
on the line following the declaration.  However, the parser is not terribly
predictable when dealing with this style due to the way in which semi-colon
inference is implemented.  Many headaches will be saved by simply following the
curly brace convention demonstrated above.


### Parentheses

In the rare cases when parenthetical blocks wrap across lines, the opening and
closing parentheses should be unspaced and kept on the same lines as their content
(Lisp-style):
    
    (this + is a very ++ long *
      expression)
      
The only exception to this rule is when defining grammars using parser combinators:
    
    lazy val e: Parser[Int] = (
        e ~ "+" ~ e  ^^ { (e1, _, e2) => e1 + e2 }
      | e ~ "-" ~ e  ^^ { (e1, _, e2) => e1 - e2 }
      | """\d+""".r  ^^ { _.toInt }
    )
    
Parser combinators are an internal DSL, however, meaning that many of these style
guidelines are inapplicable.
